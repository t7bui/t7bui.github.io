                        I have always driven to explore and understand the concepts of equity, 
                        inclusion, and belonging. My passion lies in creating inclusive designs that effectively communicate 
                        with diverse audience, bridging gaps and fostering connection. I am dedicated to develop user-centric products 
                        that prioritize ease of use and accessibility. By placing users at the center of my design process, I strive to 
                        create meaningful experiences that resonate with their needs. <br><br>
        
                        In my leisure time, I enjoy reading nonfictions and thriller fiction books, playing video games, 
                        watching movies, particularly action thrillers, animations, and forensic documentaries. This is a bit random, 
                        but I also enjoy the simplicity of taking moments to look up at the sky and doing nothing in particular. &#128516;

                            My nickname is Bunny ever since I was young. Along with my love for different shades of orange and brown, 
                            I combined my favorite colors with the color that represents Bunny to create my brand's colors.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy simplicity, cleanness, and efficiency. 
                            Hence the hexagon in my logo was inspired by our bees who cleverly build their simple and effficient honeycombs with remarkable skills.

                            I find fun in finding patterns and harmonizing opposite together to create a beautiful 
                            and unified whole. Coincidently, hexagon shape also symbolized harmony and balance.

                <p style="font-size: 1.25vw;">
                    Designing, to me, is not only a means of communication but also a way to connect with individuals who 
                    possess diverse backgrounds and perspectives. <br><br>

                    This belief was reinforced during my transition to the U.S. in 6th grade when I faced 
                    language and culture barriers. With limited English skills, I struggled to communicate 
                    with my classmates. Fortunately, I met a mutual friend who had recently transferred 
                    from a different elementary school. Despite the communication challenges, we were able 
                    to break that barrier through art. We expressed our emotions and thoughts through our 
                    drawings and laughed at those silly artwork &#128517; She patiently taught the English translations 
                    for the things we drew, and thanks to her, my English skills improved tremendously. 
                    This experience highlighted the power of design as a universal language, allowing for 
                    meaningful connections to be formed.
