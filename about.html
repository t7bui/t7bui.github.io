                <h1 style="font-size: 4vw; margin-bottom: 4%;">Hi there. I'm Thanh!</h1>
                <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                    I have always driven to explore and understand the concepts of equity, 
                    inclusion, and belonging. My passion lies in creating inclusive designs that effectively communicate 
                    with diverse audience, bridging gaps and fostering connection. I am dedicated to develop user-centric products 
                    that prioritize ease of use and accessibility. By placing users at the center of my design process, I strive to 
                    create meaningful experiences that resonate with their needs. <br><br>
    
                    In my leisure time, I enjoy reading nonfictions and thriller fiction books, playing video games, 
                    watching movies, particularly action thrillers, animations, and forensic documentaries. This is a bit random, 
                    but I also enjoy the simplicity of taking moments to look up at the sky and doing nothing in particular. &#128516;

            <h2 style="font-size: 3.5vw; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 3%;">Why do I Enjoy Designing?</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25vw;">
                Designing, to me, is not only a means of communication but also a way to connect with individuals who 
                possess diverse backgrounds and perspectives. <br><br>

                This belief was reinforced during my transition to the U.S. in 6th grade when I faced 
                language and culture barriers. With limited English skills, I struggled to communicate 
                with my classmates. Fortunately, I met a mutual friend who had recently transferred 
                from a different elementary school. Despite the communication challenges, we were able 
                to break that barrier through art. We expressed our emotions and thoughts through our 
                drawings and laughed at those silly artwork &#128517; She patiently taught the English translations 
                for the things we drew, and thanks to her, my English skills improved tremendously. 
                This experience highlighted the power of design as a universal language, allowing for 
                meaningful connections to be formed.
