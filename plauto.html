                The motivation behind exploring this topic stems from its importance and productivity, 
                which are primarily gained through experience rather than formal education. This topic has 
                a profound impact on personal and organizational performance, growth, and success. As college students, 
                we are particularly interested in understanding how to reduce distractions and enhance focus. Additionally, 
                we aim to investigate how managers can effectively supervise their teams while fulfilling their own responsibilities 
                to ensure successful project management.

                    The problem lies in the cumbersome manual work involved in project planning, 
                    where project managers often face challenges in breaking down large projects into 
                    smaller milestones, and creating effective timelines that prevent overwhelm and 
                    encourage proactive execution. <br><br>
                    How might we create a unified and user-friendly project planning platform that breaks down 
                    projects into manageable milestones and timeline through automation? <br><br>
                    Introducing Plauto, an automated project planning solution that revolutionizes 
                    the process by allowing users to upload project descriptions and deadlines. 
                    Plauto scans the information and generates a comprehensive plan with a timeline, 
                    enabling users to initiate their work while retaining the freedom to customize 
                    their schedule according to their individual preferences and availability.

                    From our SET analysis, we saw some interesting topics that people are still struggling with attention and productivity. 
                    Through our online research, we found some of the main problems that people are experiencing relating to time management, 
                    distractions, remote work, and the information/functionality overload of some applications.

                <p>
                    From our online research, we discovered many challenges in terms of attention and productivity. 
                    The problems in time management arise from blurred boundaries between work and personal life 
                    due to remote work, managers setting unrealistic deadlines resulting in a messy timeline for 
                    team members, distractions caused by social media algorithms and mobile devices, the shift 
                    to virtual meetings in post-COVID era, and the overwhelming abundance of information and 
                    functionality overload.

                <p>
                    Here we conduct surveys to understand our stakeholders needs/desires.Â 
                    Based on our SET analysis and online research, the goal for the survey is to explore the cause of distraction, 
                    identify user pain points around existing tools, and recognize important productivity features.
                </p>
                <h3>Survey Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    The target audience for our survey includes non-UCSD students (high school & college), 
                    working professionals, former supervisors, mentors, and we plan to distribute it through 
                    various channels such as email outreach to supervisors and mentors, reaching out to student 
                    organization advisors, and posting on LinkedIn to engage with a wider network of working 
                    professionals.

                    Based on our survey, we discovered that new users often struggle with the 
                    learning curve of current planning platforms, and task prioritization emerged 
                    as the most important feature desired by nearly 100% of participants. To investigate 
                    further, we looked into various project planning applications to assess their 
                    effectiveness in aiding task prioritization and see how users are reacting while 
                    using the platforms. Although these applications offer many features like personalization, 
                    customization, team collaboration, and integration with other platforms, 
                    it is true that the tools can be quite complex for users with little experience or technical knowledge.

                <p>
                    Up until this point, we have been focused on creating a single 
                    project management platform that could address various challenges such as distractions, 
                    learning curves, collaboration, and project planning problems. However, we recognized this 
                    might be a <span style="color: var(--orange)">potential risk for our project</span>  if we continue on this path, attempting to solve all 
                    these problems simultaneously instead of focusing on one specific issue. Consequently, we decided 
                    to pivot our project direction and start to formulate new five different âHow Might Weâ questions and devise corresponding needs and solutions for each problem, which guide us in creating storyboards for our revised approach.

                    <br><br>
                    The five problems include: notification distractions, learning curve & adaptability, 
                    team collaboration & accountability, manual planning and timeline, remote work challenges, 
                    and motivation to start working.
