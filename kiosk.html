                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>
                    The University of California - San Diego (UCSD) is a beautiful campus that attracts 
                    tourists with its many sightseeing attractions. One of the unique attractions of UCSD 
                    is the Stuart Collection, a permanent collection of 20 site-specific sculptures commissioned 
                    by leading contemporary artists and located throughout the campus. However, starting in 2020, 
                    one of the sculptures called Fallen Star was closed to the public, restricting visitors' ability 
                    to fully experience its unique intriguing interior. <br><br>

                    To address this issue, we propose a plan to design and install a virtual tour kiosk that 
                    helps users experience Fallen Star despite its restrictions. In addition to showcasing Fallen Star, 
                    the kiosk also provides visitors with short descriptions and locations of the other sculptures in the 
                    Stuart Collection, encouraging them to explore the campus and discover the other unique art pieces.
                </p>

                <h2>Fieldwork/Observations</h2>

                <p>
                    The goal of this step is to understand the user environment and think of possible kiosk 
                    locations for installation. Since Fallen Star is on the top floor of Irwin & Joan Jacobs 
                    School of Engineering, is it busy up there during the week? Where could our kiosk be located 
                    so that it is accessible to everyone? <br>
                    After 2-3 days of observations, we found that people are many people walk around in front 
                    of Irwin & Joan Jacobs School of Engineering, but not that many people go all the way to the 
                    top floor to see Fallen Star.  <br>
                    We came up with some possible locations for the kiosk. One is to have it on the ground floor 
                    inside of Irwin & Joan Jacobs School of Engineering, two is to have one outside of the building, 
                    three is to have one on the top floor outside of Fallen Star door, and one on the ground floor outside
                    of Irwin & Joan Jacobs School of Engineering building.
                </p>

                <h2>Exploratory Interview</h2>
                <p>
                    During our informal interviews we want to gain more insights on what are the 
                    experiences that users have with Fallen Star thus far and also ask for suggestions 
                    of possible kiosk locations. We interviewed around 8 people, ranging from first-year 
                    students to staff members to gain more insights about the experiences they have had with 
                    Fallen Star thus far. We also ask about what they want to see on a virtual tour if we have 
                    one for Fallen Star and the possible location for it. <br>
                    We found that while many first and second-year students have not 
                    had the opportunity to see Fallen Star, some were able to visit for 
                    classroom purposes. Many people suggested that it would be more accessible for 
                    everyone if we install the kiosk outside on the ground floor of Irwin & Joan Jacobs School 
                    of Engineering. Furthermore, we should incorporate a tour guide to tell the story behind the 
                    artist’s intention for this sculpture.

                    Jeff is taking a walk around the UCSD campus. 
                    He has been around a while now, so he knows that Fallen Star exists but doesn’t 
                    know much about it and isn’t interested enough to visit it. While passing by WLH, 
                    he notices a new kiosk in front of the engineering building, right under Fallen Star. 
                    Curious, he explores the kiosk and is enamored by the deeper meaning and the engineering background 
                    behind the art installation. He becomes interested in Fallen Star and makes plans to visit it in 
                    person in the future.

                        <b>Kiosk Location Problem</b><br>
                        Bobby is a first-year student at UCSD wandering around to explore 
                        the new campus during the weekend. He saw an interesting tilted house on 
                        top of the Engineering building near Warren. He wants to get into the building, 
                        but it is locked. While looking around, he discovered a Kiosk about that tilted house 
                        and found out the house's actual name is Fallen Star. After looking through all the 
                        information and a short virtual tour of the building, he is glad that there is something 
                        to look at while he could not see the house up close and get the in-person experience.
