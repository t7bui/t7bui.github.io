                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>
                    The University of California - San Diego (UCSD) is a beautiful campus that attracts 
                    tourists with its many sightseeing attractions. One of the unique attractions of UCSD 
                    is the Stuart Collection, a permanent collection of 20 site-specific sculptures commissioned 
                    by leading contemporary artists and located throughout the campus. However, starting in 2020, 
                    one of the sculptures called Fallen Star was closed to the public, restricting visitors' ability 
                    to fully experience its unique intriguing interior. <br><br>

                    To address this issue, we propose a plan to design and install a virtual tour kiosk that 
                    helps users experience Fallen Star despite its restrictions. In addition to showcasing Fallen Star, 
                    the kiosk also provides visitors with short descriptions and locations of the other sculptures in the 
                    Stuart Collection, encouraging them to explore the campus and discover the other unique art pieces.

                <h2>Fieldwork/Observations</h2>

                <p>
                    To understand the user environment and identify suitable kiosk locations for installation, 
                    we observed the activity around Fallen Star on the top floor of Irwin & Joan Jacobs School of Engineering. 
                    After a few days of observation, we noticed that while many people pass by the building, 
                    fewer individuals actually venture to the top floor to see the sculpture. As a result, we propose several 
                    potential kiosk locations: inside the ground floor of the engineering school, outside the building, outside the 
                    Fallen Star door on the top floor, or outside the Irwin & Joan Jacobs School of Engineering building on the ground floor.
                </p>

                <h2>Exploratory Interview</h2>
                <p>
                    In our informal interviews, we gathered insights from 8 individuals, including students and staff members, 
                    about their experiences with Fallen Star. We discovered that while some students had limited exposure to the sculpture, 
                    there was interest in a virtual tour. The suggestion to install a kiosk on the ground floor of Irwin & Joan Jacobs School 
                    of Engineering emerged as a way to enhance accessibility. Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of incorporating
                    a tour guide to provide insights into the artist's intention behind the sculpture.

                    Jeff is taking a walk around the UCSD campus. 
                    He has been around a while now, so he knows that Fallen Star exists but doesn’t 
                    know much about it and isn’t interested enough to visit it. While passing by WLH, 
                    he notices a new kiosk in front of the engineering building, right under Fallen Star. 
                    Curious, he explores the kiosk and is enamored by the deeper meaning and the engineering background 
                    behind the art installation. He becomes interested in Fallen Star and makes plans to visit it in 
                    person in the future.

                        <b>Kiosk Location Problem</b><br>
                        Bobby is a first-year student at UCSD wandering around to explore 
                        the new campus during the weekend. He saw an interesting tilted house on 
                        top of the Engineering building near Warren. He wants to get into the building, 
                        but it is locked. While looking around, he discovered a Kiosk about that tilted house 
                        and found out the house's actual name is Fallen Star. After looking through all the 
                        information and a short virtual tour of the building, he is glad that there is something 
                        to look at while he could not see the house up close and get the in-person experience.
