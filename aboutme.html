                <h2>thB - Thanh Bui</h2>
            <p>Hello! I (she/her/hers) was born in Vietnam and grew up in California. 
                Iâ€™m currently a senior at UCSD majoring in Math-Applied (Cognitive Science) and
                minoring in Design. <br><br>
                My biggest passion is being able to help others with all the skills that I have. <br><br>
                Focusing in applying Math to Cognitive Science, I was able to learn how 
                we as humans can help computer train and improve over time through Mathematical models. 
                Designing not only allows me to express myself through art, but it also allows me to creatively think
                of new ways to solve problems and create products that could benefit others.
