            <p>Hello world!<br><br>
            I (she/her/hers) was born in Vietnam and grew up in California. 
            Iâ€™m currently a senior at UCSD majoring in Math-Applied (Cognitive) Science and
            minoring in Design. <br><br>
            My biggest passion is being able to help others with all the skills that I have. <br><br>
            Focusing in applying Math to Cognitive Science, I was able to learn how 
            we as humans can make our lives a bit easier by training and letting computer learn over time through 
            Mathematical models. <br><br>
            Everyone has their own creative side that they sometimes do not realize until you meet someone that 
            recognizes that hidden side of yours. 
            I only discovered my creative side during my first year of college when I met such an amazing group of people, 
            career coaches, and supervisor. Even with little experience, I still try my best
            to practice and improve that side of mine whenever opportunities come to me. :D
            Designing not only allows me to express myself through art, but it also allows me to creatively think
            of new ways to solve problems and create products that could benefit others.
