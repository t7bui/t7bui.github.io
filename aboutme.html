            <p>Hello world!<br><br>
            I (she/her/hers) was born in Vietnam and grew up in California. 
            Iâ€™m currently a senior at UCSD majoring in Math-Applied (Cognitive) Science and
            minoring in Design. <br><br>
            My biggest passion is being able to help others with all the skills that I have. <br><br>
            <!-- While in school, I was able to learn technical and hard skills in class by reading class materials, working on fun and exciting projects.
            While learning those technical skills, I realized that there are many soft skills that I was learning 
            and applying without even realizing. 
            To be a good programmer, mathematician, or designer, it is important to really understand to concepts you are learning and/or working on, 
            what the problem you're trying to solve, and how to correctly apply those concepts to solve problems. 
            It's important to put yourself in others' shoes to understand their 
            frustrations and needs in order to find right solution for everyone.
            <li>Patiently listen, learn, and observe others</li>
            <li>Empathize with your audience</li>
            <li>Work on facts not assumptions</li> -->
