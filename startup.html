            <p>
                The motivation behind exploring this topic stems from its importance and productivity, 
                which are primarily gained through experience rather than formal education. This topic has 
                a profound impact on personal and organizational performance, growth, and success. As college students, 
                we are particularly interested in understanding how to reduce distractions and enhance focus. Additionally, 
                we aim to investigate how managers can effectively supervise their teams while fulfilling their own responsibilities 
                to ensure successful project management.

                <p>
                    Up until this point, we have been focused on creating a single 
                    project management platform that could address various challenges such as distractions, 
                    learning curves, collaboration, and project planning problems. However, we recognized this 
                    might be a <span style="color: var(--orange)">potential risk for our project</span>  if we continue on this path, attempting to solve all 
                    these problems simultaneously instead of focusing on one specific issue. Consequently, we decided 
                    to pivot our project direction and start to formulate new five different “How Might We” questions and devise corresponding needs and solutions for each problem, which guide us in creating storyboards for our revised approach.

                    <br><br>
                    The five problems include: notification distractions, learning curve & adaptability, 
                    team collaboration & accountability, manual planning and timeline, remote work challenges, 
                    and motivation to start working.

                    How might we develop an intelligent notification filtering system that 
                    prioritizes relevant conversations and minimizes distractions, enabling users

                    <li>
                        There is a concern with remote work, though solution should not be relating
